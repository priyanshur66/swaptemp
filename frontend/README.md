This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Contract Integration

This application supports two approaches for loading smart contract information:

1. **Production/Deployment Environment**: The `contract` folder is auto-generated during deployment with the latest contract addresses. When using the main contract folder, the application will use whatever network the user's MetaMask is connected to.

2. **Development/Fallback Environment**: If the `contract` folder isn't available, the application falls back to using the `contract-sample` folder. This folder contains sample contract information with a specified network (e.g., "sepolia", "mainnet"). When using the sample folder, the application will prompt the user to switch to the specified network if they're connected to a different one.

The fallback mechanism is handled automatically in `src/lib/contractrefs.js`.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
